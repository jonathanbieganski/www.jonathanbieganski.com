      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jonathan Bieganski folks call me JB. I want to thank
        you for taking an interest in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started in 2005 as a member of the Microservices team at
        Computer Assiociates, which is now known as CA Technologies. The
        Microservices Manager saw something in me and gave me the opportunity of
        a lifetime; start out my career working for a large software company.
        (Thank you, Bill.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The first professional internal tool I had ever created was written at
        CA Technologies and was written in Visual basic. That was also the first
        time I had written a program outside of academia and more importantly,
        the first time I saw a tool I created used by others. I received
        professional feedback and made improvements to the tool. From that
        moment on I hooked by the creativity and utility coding facilitates.
        After the housing market crash of 2008 and the extensive layoffs
        witnessed in 2010, I took the expereince I gained at CA Technologies and
        ventured forth to apply my skills elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 2010 and 2012 I was a contractor troubleshooting and standing up
        systems. I landed an Instructional Design role at City College of San
        Francisco where I had been attending Computer Science and Ethical
        hacking courses. I'll never forget dropping off my resume in front of
        the Technology Learning Center Staff, introducing myself and being
        dismissed only to have my future managers briskly walk and stop me down
        the hallway, I assume after scanning my resume. I trained Professors how
        to create courses in Canvas and Moodle. I trained Lad Aides and
        purchased hardware and maintained the systems in the lab. I learned a
        lot about academia and thier unique needs and challenges. (Thank You,
        Vic and Carol)
      </p>
      <p>
        I left school to care for an ailing family member and picked up a few
        projects troubleshooting systems, setting up networks and security
        systems. Around this time I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager and
        eventually made her my wife. She motivated me to continue my pursuetes
        and my dream to work Silicon Valley. Eventually the Lead Systems
        Administrator at icontrol Networks, which was absorbed by Alarm.com, saw
        something in me and brought me in under his wing. (Thank you, Mike.) I
        learned about Tier 1 server updates, Atlassian Suite permissions, print
        management, VOIP and Cisco managed switch configuration. I also
        completed my very first Microsoft Certification: Enabling and Managing
        M365 (M20347). Working at Alarm.com and living directly behind Oricals
        headquaters in a tiny overproced apartment was a dream fulfilled for me.
        If I could have entertained purchasing a home and building equity near
        Silicon Valley with what I was making, I would still be there.

        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
