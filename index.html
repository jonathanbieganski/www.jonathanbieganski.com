          My career began in 2005 at CA Technologies on their Microservices
          team, thanks to an opportunity from the Microservices Manager Bill.
          There, I created my first professional internal tool in Visual Basic,
          sparking my passion for coding and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the 2008 housing market crash, I broadened my skills as a
          contractor, troubleshooting systems and networks. I transitioned to an
          Instructional Design role at City College of San Francisco, training
          professors and managing lab systems. This experience taught me many
          valuable lessons about academia's unique needs and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly stepped away from my career to care for a family member,
          taking on troubleshooting and networking projects when possible. It
          was during this time that I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager
          Amanda. I convinced her to marry me and she encouraged me to follow my
          dream to fully rejoin the tech field and focus my efforts in Silicon
          Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Lead Systems Administrator at iControl Networks recognized my
          potential and brought me on board, where I gained experience in
          various tech areas and obtained my first Microsoft Certification.
          icontrol networks was absorbed by Alarm.com, where I honed my skills
          in server management, VOIP, and more. The high cost of living in
          Silicon Valley led me to reluctantly leave Alarm.com and relocate to
          Sacramento, where I became a Junior System Administrator at Magnit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IT Director at RSN Technologies offered a System Administrator
          role where I managed a team and handled various IT responsibilities,
          especially during the beginning challenges of the Covid pandemic. When
          circumstances changed, I sold my Sacramento home, moved to Oregon, and
          began working for Fisher Phillips. There, I've taken on roles such as
          managing Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager, implementing
          Intune and automating processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a diverse background in the tech industry and a recent focus on
          Microsoft Azure Cloud Services, I'm open to connecting and discussing
          opportunities.

        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
          respective domains. JonathanBieganski.com and BieganskiFarm.com are
          hosted using Azure DNS within their respective tenants, each serving a
          distinct purpose.

        <p>
          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
