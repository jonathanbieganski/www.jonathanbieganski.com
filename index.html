      <p>
        My tech career began in 2005 at CA Technologies on their Microservices
        team. There I gained exposure to production and testing environments
        which included linux systems, server farms, hypervisors. I programmed my
        first few internal tools sparking my passion for problem-solving and
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the housing market crash and the following recession I began my
        formal studies in computer science and ethical hacking at City College
        of San Francisco. While attending I worked as an Instructional Designer
        in their Technology Learning Center. I trained professors and Lab Aides
        to construct Canvas and Moodle courses. I managed the systems. This
        experience taught me many valuable lessons about academia's unique needs
        and challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I briefly stepped away from my studies and design career to care for a
        family member, taking on projects when possible. It was during this time
        that I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager. I eventually convinced her
        to marry me. She played a pivotal role in helping me redirect my focus
        and pursue my ambition of working in tech within Silicon Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lead Systems Administrator at iControl Networks recognized my
        potential and brought me onboard. There I gained experience in various
        systems and earned my first Microsoft Certification. Alarm.com absorded
        icontrol networks. I began to specialize in Azure, M365, Windows Server
        and macOS. The high cost of living in Silicon Valley led me to resign
        and relocate to Sacramento where lined up a junior System Administrator
        position at Magnit.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some time at Magnit managing their systems and writing some
        PowerShell scripts I was offered a System Administrator role by IT
        Director of RSN Technologies. There I managed a small team and managed
        mutiple tenants and systems. At the very beginning of the covid
        pandemic, when lockdowns began, circumstances changed, we sold our home
        in Sacramento and moved to Oregon.
      </p>
      <p>
        After settling in to our new property in Oregon I began work at Fisher
        Phillips. This is my current employer and my role is quite varied. I
        manage Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager & Microsoft
        Endpoint Configuration Manager, lead projects, stand up systems, create
        workflows and write automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With numerous years of experience and a diverse background in tech,
        coupled with expertise in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services and the M365
        Stack, I am eager to engage in conversations and explore fresh
        opportunities. I bring a wealth of valuable skills and insights that can
        be of great benefit.
