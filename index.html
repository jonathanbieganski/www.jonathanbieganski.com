      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I started my tech career back in 2005 as a member of the Microservices
        team at Computer Assiociates, now known as CA Technologies. This is
        where I wrote my first professional internal tool via Visual basic for
        me and my colleagues to leverage. After the market crash of 2008 and the
        extensive layoffs in 2010, I took the expereince and exposure I gained
        from CA Technologies and ventured forth to apply my skill at new
        opportunities. With extensive experience in the tech industry, I
        specialize in Azure Cloud Services and automated solutions. I've worked
        in diverse corporate settings. Please look around and feel free to
        contact and connect with me.

        <h3>Project: Azure Tenants & Domains</h3>
        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its

          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
