        <p>Thank you for taking an interest.</p>

          My tech career began in 2005 at CA Technologies on their Microservices
          team. There, I created my first professional internal tool in Visual
          Basic, sparking my passion for problem-solving and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the 2008 housing market crash, I broadened my skills
          troubleshooting systems and networks. I was studying computer science
          when I transitioned to an Instructional Design role at City College of
          San Francisco. I trained professors and managed the lab. This
          experience taught me many valuable lessons about academia's unique
          needs and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly stepped away from my career to care for a family member,
          taking on tech projects when possible. It was during this time that I
          met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager. I eventually convinced her to
          marry me and she convinced me to follow my dream to work in Silicon
          Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lead Systems Administrator at iControl Networks recognized my
          potential and brought me on board. There I gained experience in
          various systems and earned my first Microsoft Certification. Alarm.com
          absorded icontrol networks. I began to honed my skills and specialize
          in Azure, M365, automation, server management and more. The high cost
          of living in Silicon Valley led me to resign and relocate to
          Sacramento where lined up a junior System Administrator position at
          Magnit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IT Director at RSN Technologies reached out and offered me an IT
          Manager / System Administrator role. I managed a small team and
          handled various IT responsibilities. At the beginning of the covid
          pandemic, when lockdowns began and circumstances changed, I sold my
          Sacramento home and moved to Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started work at Fisher Phillips. There, my role is varied. I manage
          Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager & Microsoft Endpoint
          Configuration Manager, Manage projects, stand up ITCM solutions, write
          scripts, create workflows and automations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a diverse background in tech and a specialization in Microsoft
          Azure Cloud Services and M365 Stack, I'm open to connecting and
          discussing new opportunities.

        <h3>Project: Azure Tenants & Domains</h3>
        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
          respective domains. JonathanBieganski.com and BieganskiFarm.com are
          hosted using Azure DNS within their respective tenants, each serving a
          distinct purpose.

        <p>
          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
