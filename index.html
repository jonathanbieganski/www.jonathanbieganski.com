        <p>
          My tech career began in 2005 at CA Technologies on their Microservices
          team. There I gained exposure to production and testing environments
          which included linux systems, server farms, hypervisors. I programmed
          my first few internal tools sparking my passion for problem-solving
          and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the housing market crash and the following recession I began my
          formal studies in computer science and ethical hacking at City College
          of San Francisco. While attending I worked as an Instructional
          Designer in their Technology Learning Center. I trained professors and
          Lab Aides to construct Canvas and Moodle courses. I managed the
          systems. This experience taught me many valuable lessons about
          academia's unique needs and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly stepped away from my studies and design career to care for a
          family member, taking on projects when possible. It was during this
          time that I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager. I eventually
          convinced her to marry me. She played a pivotal role in helping me
          redirect my focus and pursue my ambition of working in tech within
          Silicon Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lead Systems Administrator at iControl Networks recognized my
          potential and brought me onboard. There I gained experience in various
          systems and earned my first Microsoft Certification. Alarm.com
          absorded icontrol networks. I began to specialize in Azure, M365,
          Windows Server and macOS. The high cost of living in Silicon Valley
          led me to resign and relocate to Sacramento where lined up a junior
          System Administrator position at Magnit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time at Magnit managing their systems and writing some
          PowerShell scripts I was offered a System Administrator role by IT
          Director of RSN Technologies. There I managed a small team and managed
          mutiple tenants and systems. At the very beginning of the covid
          pandemic, when lockdowns began, circumstances changed, we sold our
          home in Sacramento and moved to Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          After settling in to our new property in Oregon I began work at Fisher
          Phillips. This is my current employer and my role is quite varied. I
          manage Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager & Microsoft
          Endpoint Configuration Manager, lead projects, stand up systems,
          create workflows and write automation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With numerous years of experience and a diverse background in tech,
          coupled with expertise in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services and the M365
          Stack, I am eager to engage in conversations and explore fresh
          opportunities. I bring a wealth of valuable skills and insights that
          can be of great benefit.

        <h3>Project: Azure Tenants & Domains</h3>
        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
          respective domains. JonathanBieganski.com and BieganskiFarm.com are
          hosted using Azure DNS within their respective tenants, each serving a
          distinct purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
