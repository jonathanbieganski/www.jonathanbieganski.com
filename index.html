          Thank you for taking an interest in me today and thank you to each and
          every person that either hired me or had a role in my hiring. Without
          your contribution to my career I would not be the person I am today.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career started in 2005 as a member of the Microservices team at
          Computer Assiociates, which is now known as CA Technologies. The
          Microservices Manager saw something in me and gave me the opportunity
          of a lifetime; start out my career working for a large software
          company. (Thank you, Bill.) The first professional internal tool I had
          ever created was written at CA Technologies and was written in Visual
          basic. That was also the first time I had written a program outside of
          academia and more importantly, the first time I saw a tool I created
          used by others. I received professional feedback and made improvements
          to the tool. From that moment on I hooked by the creativity and
          utility coding facilitates. After the housing market crash of 2008 and
          the extensive layoffs witnessed in 2010, I took the expereince I
          gained at CA Technologies and ventured forth to apply my skills
          elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 2010 and 2012 I was a contractor troubleshooting and standing
          up systems. I landed an Instructional Design role at City College of
          San Francisco where I had been attending Computer Science and Ethical
          hacking courses. I'll never forget dropping off my resume in front of
          the Technology Learning Center Staff, introducing myself and being
          dismissed only to have my future managers briskly walk and stop me
          down the hallway, I assume after scanning my resume. I trained
          Professors how to create courses in Canvas and Moodle. I trained Lad
          Aides and purchased hardware and maintained the systems in the lab. I
          learned a lot about academia and thier unique needs and challenges.
          (Thank You, Vic and Carol)
        </p>
        <p>
          To care for an ailing family member, I resigned my role and
          coursework. I picked up a few projects troubleshooting systems,
          setting up networks and security systems. Around this time I met an
          amazing EdTech Sales Manager and eventually convinced her to marry me.
          (Thank you, Amanda.) Amande motivated me to get back into tech field
          proper and continue my dream to work and experience Silicon Valley. A
          Lead Systems Administrator at icontrol Networks, which was absorbed by
          Alarm.com, saw something in me and brought me in under him. (Thank
          you, Mike.) I learned about Second Tuesday Microsoft Server updates,
          Atlassian Suite permissions, print management, VOIP and Cisco managed
          switch configuration. I also completed my very first Microsoft
          Certification: Enabling and Managing M365 (M20347). Working at
          Alarm.com and living directly behind Oricals headquaters in a tiny
          overproced apartment was a dream fulfilled. With that said, if I could
          have entertained purchasing a home and building equity anywhere near
          Silicon Valley, I would still be at Alarm.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          We found our first home near Sacramento Calfornia where I had
          successfully acquired a role as a Junior System Administrator at
          Magnit. (Thank you, Robert.) I wrote scripts, managed the Microsoft,
          Mimecast and Sophos portals. Home ownership is expensive and an
          opportunity to become as a full fledged System Administrator was
          available at RSN Technologies. (Thank you, Charlie.) While at RSN, I
          managed a team of five ServiceDesk members, interviewed candidates,
          managed multiple Microsoft Tenants, implemented MDM solutions and
          handled the occasional escalations. RSN specialized in managing
          services for nursing homes. Covid was an especially difficult time for
          us and our clients. As early days of Covid and lockdowns started my
          service at RSN were no longer warranted.

          During the first California lockdown we decided to put our house on
          the market and look for property with some land. We managed to sell
          our home in Sacremento fairly quickly and shortly after moved into our
          new rural property outside Portland, OR. I interviewed with my current
          employer Fisher Phillips shortly after arriving in Oregon. Once hired,
          I directly reported to the Director of Information Technology. (Thank
          you, Michael & Joey) I started my career at Fisher Phillips by taking
          over Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager from the Systems
          Team, migrated away from and sunseting ServiceNow and created a few
          PowerAutomate workflows. Recently I have been living in Microsoft
          Endpoint Configuration Manager implementing Intune for our many
          entities.
