          My tech career began in 2005 at CA Technologies on their Microservices
          team. There I gained exposure to testing and production linux systems,
          server farms, hypervisors and programmed my first professional
          internal tool sparking my passion for problem-solving and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the housing market crash and the following recession I began my
          formal studies in computer science and ethical hacking at City College
          of San Francisco. While attending I worked as an Instructional
          Designer in their Technology Learning Center. I trained professors and
          managed the Center's systems. This experience taught me many valuable
          lessons about academia's unique needs and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I briefly stepped away from my studies and Design career to care for a
          family member, taking on projects when possible. It was during this
          time that I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager. I eventually
          convinced her to marry me. She played a pivotal role in helping me
          redirect my focus and pursue my ambition of working in tech within
          Silicon Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lead Systems Administrator at iControl Networks recognized my
          potential and brought me onboard. There I gained experience in various
          systems and earned my first Microsoft Certification. Alarm.com
          absorded icontrol networks. I began to specialize in Azure, M365,
          Windows Server and macOS. The high cost of living in Silicon Valley
          led me to resign and relocate to Sacramento where lined up a junior
          System Administrator position at Magnit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time at Magnit managing their systems and writing some
          PowerShell scripts I was offered a System Administrator role by IT
          Director of RSN Technologies. There I managed a small team and managed
          mutiple tenants and systems. At the very beginning of the covid
          pandemic, when lockdowns began, circumstances changed, we sold our
          Sacramento home and moved to Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started work at Fisher Phillips. There my role is quite varied. I
          manage Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager & Microsoft
          Endpoint Configuration Manager, Manage projects, stood up multiple
          ITCM solutions, write scripts, create workflows and automations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With numerous years of experience and a diverse background in the
          tech, coupled with expertise in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services and the
          M365 Stack, I am eager to engage in conversations and explore fresh
          opportunities. I believe I bring a wealth of valuable skills and
          insights that can greatly benefit your company.

        <h3>Project: Azure Tenants & Domains</h3>
        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
          respective domains. JonathanBieganski.com and BieganskiFarm.com are
          hosted using Azure DNS within their respective tenants, each serving a
          distinct purpose.

          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
