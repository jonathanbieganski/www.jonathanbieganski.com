      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I started my tech career in 2005 as a member of the Microservices team
        at Computer Assiociates, which is now known as CA Technologies. This was
        where I wrote my first professional internal tool written in Visual
        basic. That was also the first time I had written a program outside of
        academia and more importantly, the first time I received professional
        feedback and grattitude for coding ingenuity. I was hooked, bit and
        forever changed by the coding bug.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the housing market crash of 2008 and the extensive layoffs
        witnessed firsthand in 2010, I took the expereince I gained at CA
        Technologies and ventured forth to apply my skills elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        I landed an Instructional Design position at the local community college
        where I was a student.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left school to care for an ailing family member and picked up a few
        projects troubleshooting systems, setting up networks and security
        systems. Around this time I met an amazing EdTech Sales Manager and
        eventually made her my wife. She motivated me to continue my pursuetes
        and dream to work Silicon Valley. The Lead Systems Administrator at
        icontrol Networks, which was absorbed by Alarm.com, saw something in me
        and brought me in under his wing. I learned about Tier 1 server updates,
        Atlassian Suite permissions, print management, VOIP and Cisco managed
        switch configuration. I also completed my very first Microsoft
        Certification: Enabling and Managing M365 (M20347).
      </p>
      <p>
        With extensive experience in the tech industry, I specialize in Azure
        Cloud Services and automated solutions. I've worked in diverse corporate
        settings. Please look around and feel free to contact and connect with
        me.

        <h3>Project: Azure Tenants & Domains</h3>
        <p>
          I presently manage two Azure tenants, each associated with its
          respective domains. JonathanBieganski.com and BieganskiFarm.com are
          hosted using Azure DNS within their respective tenants, each serving a

          BieganskiFarm.com is hosted via Azure DNS Zone Services and an
          instance of Azure Static Web App. Microsoft Entra provides the
          authority, IAM and MFA for all it's members. The endpoints were joined
          to the domain via Microsoft Intune
